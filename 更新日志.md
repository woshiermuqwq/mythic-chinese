General
-------

### Added Java 16 support

### Skill Parameters (Premium Feature)
Skill parameters are a new feature allowing you to more easily create generic skills and pass parameters to them from other skills. If that sounds confusing, here's an example!

Currently most people have a lot similar damage skills that are just tweaked a bit for all their different mobs for slight variances in damage, but they do basically the same thing otherwise.

**The old way of doing it:**
```
ShadowDamage20:
  Skills:
  - damage{amount=20}
  - some shadowy effect

ShadowDamage50:
  Skills:
  - damage{amount=50}
  - some shadowy effect

Mob1:
  Skills:
  - skill:ShadowDamage20 ~onAttack

Mob2:
  Skills:
  - skill:ShadowDamage50 ~onAttack
```

**With Skill Parameters, we can combine these all into a single skill! The new way:**
```
ShadowDamage:
  Skills:
  - damage{amount=<skill.damage>}

Mob1:
  Skills:
  - skill:ShadowDamage{damage=20} ~onAttack

Mob2:
  Skills:
  - skill:ShadowDamage{damage=50} ~onAttack
```
The "skill parameter" system will pass __any__ options from the **skill/metaskill** mechanic (except options that are specific to it) down the skill tree where you can reference them later. If a later skill passes the same parameter, it will overwrite it. These can be used anywhere placeholders are supported.

```
- skill{skill=SomeSkill;anything=2;somethingElse=5}

SomeSkill:
  Skills:
  - particles{amount=<skill.anything>}
  - damage{amount=<skill.somethingElse>}
```

Mobs
----
### NEW: EXPERIENCE_ORB
- Added EXPERIENCE_ORB mob type (why?)
- Can specify Options.Experience: amount

Mechanics
---------

### NEW: Origin Override (Premium Feature)
- Added `origin=@targeter` option to set the origin in any mechanic. Will pass through to any child mechanics.

### BreakBlock
- Added doDrops, doEffect, useTool options

### Disguise **MAJOR CHANGE** 
- Renamed disguise mechanic to disguiseOld
- Disguise now just accepts a LibsDisguises config string with d=

### FAWEPaste
- Added chestDropTable option
- Allows you to specify a MythicMobs droptable that will automagically populate and randomize any chests in that schematic when it's pasted

### FillChest
- Fills a chest at the targeted location with the contents of a droptable

### GiveItem
- Added fakeLooting=true option to play the pickup-item animation from the origin

### Messages
- Added audience option

### ModifyProjectile
- Added radius trait for orbitals

### Projectiles
- Greatly improved block collision detection
- Improved collision detection with huge mobs (giants, ghasts, etc)
- Improved collision detection with ModelEngine mobs

### RemoveAura
- You can now specify "ANY" to remove all auras from the target

### NEW: ChainMissile (Premium Feature)
- Combines the Chain and Missile mechanics, making a missile that will bounce between so many targets

### NEW: giveItemFromTarget
- Gives the caster an item while playing the pickup-item animation from the target entity or location

### NEW: raytraceTo (premium-only)
- Raytraces from the origin to the targeted location
- Same options as the raytrace mechanic

### NEW: ShootShulkerBullet

- Has onTick, onHit, onEnd otpions

### NEW: clearThreat

Effects
-------

### Audiences
- Added *caster* audience
- Added *@targeter* audience, allowing you to use any entity-targeter as an audience

### Particle Effects - Mob particles??? **(premium-only)**
- Added special type particle=mob on all particle effects
- You can then specify a MythicMob using mob=[type]
- This is a hacky way for you to use mobs as "particles" in effects using no-tick ArmorStands wearing models or using font characters. You can use things other than ArmorStands if you want, but we don't recommend it for performance.

### BlockWave
- Added velocityX, velocityY, velocityZ, and ignoreAir options
