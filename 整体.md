MythicMobs allows server administrators to fully modify all
attributes of monsters on your server, and even create your own mobs,
bosses, and other many other fun mob-related things.

It gives you full control over how mobs behave, from simply increasing
their HP and damage to giving mobs a vast arsenal of new abilities with
a powerful and simple scripting system. Your custom mobs can then
replace vanilla mobs, be spawned randomly using numerous types of spawn
controls, or you can set up custom mob spawners that activate under
certain conditions or by commands.

You can finally create that ultimate boss you've always dreamed of
crushing your players with. It is an absolute essential for every RPG
server.

To sum it up, Mythic Mobs gives you control over and access to:

-   **Mob Skills**:  
    Giving mobs custom skills with powerful conditionals and delays,
    based on a robust system of triggers and/or timers

<!-- -->

-   **Mob Attributes**:  
    Modifying all mob attributes such as health, damage, speed, follow
    and combat range.

<!-- -->

-   **Special Effects**:  
    Allowing mobs to use custom sounds, particles, and special effects.

<!-- -->

-   **Equipment**:  
    Setting equipment and creating custom items with attributes and drop
    tables.

<!-- -->

-   **Damage Modifiers**:  
    Change how damage affects mobs so they can be immune to drowning,
    take half damage from arrows, be healed by fire, etc.

<!-- -->

-   **Mob Spawners**:  
    Creating powerful custom Mob Spawners to spawn your Mythic Mobs at
    specific locations, with optional timers, conditions, attributes,
    cooldowns, etc!

<!-- -->

-   **Spawning Control**:  
    Set your custom mobs and bosses up to spawn randomly in different
    areas of the world, based on any number of conditions you can
    specify. You can replace natural spawns completely!

<!-- -->

-   **Mob Levels**:  
    Allow mobs to scale in level and increase in power based on where
    and how they spawned, having scaled health, damage, and more
    abilities as they level!

<!-- -->

-   **Threat Tables**:  
    Allow mobs to use Threat Tables, granting increased power and
    control over their targeting behaviors and causing mobs to behave
    more like those in RPGs.

<!-- -->

-   **Mob AI Controls**:  
    Allows you to modify mob AI goals, including adding new AI goals
    found only in MythicMobs. Let zombies open doors, have friendly
    skeleton guards that fight skeletons from other mob factions, and
    more!

<!-- -->

-   **Mob Factions**:  
    Allow mobs to be a part of factions! Works with the previously
    mentioned AI Controls so you can have mobs that will fight other
    factions of mobs, help players, and more!

<!-- -->

-   **Disguises**:  
    Integration with LibsDisguises allows any mob to look like
    *anything*.

<!-- -->

-   **Plugin Compatibility**:  
    Integration with a wide variety of popular plugins!

<!-- -->

-   *Much more to come!*

Development Builds
------------------

Development builds are available to premium users, and can be found here:

<http://www.mythicmobs.net/dev>

Please note that development builds have untested features, and while I
do not believe they will damage your server in any way, I can make no
guarantees about it. They could potentially alter and/or break your
previous MythicMobs configurations and may contain bugs and unfinished
features. Please make sure you read changelogs fully.
